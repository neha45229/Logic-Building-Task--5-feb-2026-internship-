This repository having all the 10 task which are assigned by my mentor for 5th day of my Internship with innomatics Research lab.
Each task is having its own and unique applications in real-world.
Using python it makes easier to solve the complex problems with some small part of python code.
And each code is uploaded in my file and its all code are consisting of:
**Functions** as common beacause it makes usage and process easy without taking longer time to give response
**Loops** which helps in doing response whether it may be 1 or n attempts related to its no.of iterations having in its code.
**conditions** important part of code because having any kind of condition it helps to get exact output which we need.
each code is unique and usefull
